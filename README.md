On the use of Chat GPT:
Chat GPT was used throughout the project to help with bug checking code. Additionally it was used to simplify the class tutorials as well as online resources.
I did this so I could better understand the complicated notes and resources I found online. This was mostly used for game three as I found it confusing and difficult to understand.
With the use of Chat GPT I was able to better understand what the lecture notes meant and what the code supplied did. I occasionally used it to give me hints on what the best method
might be for a function I was implementing myself.
